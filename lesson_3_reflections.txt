1.) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you were making changes on another computer or someone else was making changes from another computer. 
Or if you wanted the changes to be instantly available instead of having to commit from local repository.


2.) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if you have alot of people working on the same project you couldn't possibly keep up with the changes
fast enough when it updates and it would be awfully hard for your code to work.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are when you don't have permission to edit someones repository and when you want to add things to it while
giving them credit for their share of the code without effecting their repository (takes the place of cloning),
cloning a repository is basically copying all fo the files in a repository and putting them on your computer and initialisig
them to git, both of these methods automaticlaly create remotes pointing to the url you got them from by default. Branches
are alternate paths from the main code where you can try experimental changes like alternate languages without worrying
about the main code and can them merge them back later without effecting functionality of the main branch.

4.) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to work offline and commit the changes later, like if you were on a airplane or something
